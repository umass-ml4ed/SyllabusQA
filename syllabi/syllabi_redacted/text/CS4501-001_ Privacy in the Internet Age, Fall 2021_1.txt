Therefore, you can expect that students in your class are vaccinated. A very small number of students have received vaccination exemptions, so the likelihood that an unvaccinated student is in your class is slight. Q: How will you accommodate a student who needs to isolate/quarantine? If a student informs us that they cannot attend class in-person because they have been requested to isolate or quarantine due to possible exposure to COVID-19, we will treat you as we would any other student absent due to illness. You will have access to the recordings of the lecture, either synchronously or asynchronously. You can also continue to interact with your team via Discord and other online tools. Q: What if the professor has to isolate/quarantine (either for herself or because of a family member)? We will have Zoom-only lectures and recordings. If this happens, we will send a Collab announcement. Q: What if a TA has to isolate/quarantine? The TA's office hour will be online only. Q: How will we be doing quizzes? Quizzes will be online via the “Tests & Quizzes” tab on Collab during a given time window. We may adjust this policy depending on how the semester goes. Q: Do I have to wear a mask? Our class will diligently follow all University regulations in effect. If masks are required during a certain period, then they are absolutely required for class. If policy changes, then we will adjust accordingly. Failure to mask if a regulation is in effect will result in reporting to UJC and a professionalism penalty for the class. Additionally, all in person office hours will require masking, regardless of location. Q: Is the professor going to wear a mask? Yes, with the exception of active lecturing behind the plastic shield in accordance with the latest guideline.
