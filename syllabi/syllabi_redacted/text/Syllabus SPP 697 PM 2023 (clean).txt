SYLLABUS SPP 697 PM: Performance Management University of Massachusetts-Amherst, School of Public Policy Spring 2023 Course Instructor: <PROF_FULL_NAME> Tuesdays, 1:00 – 3:30 p.m., On-Line via Zoom Optional participation location: Rm. E-23, Machmer Hall Contact Information and Office Hours Email: <PROF_EMAIL> Office Hours: On request, via phone or Zoom. (For general questions or personal messages, please contact me by e-mail). Course Description and Goals This course will focus on the fundamentals for designing and using a performance-based management framework in the public sector, specifically in the U.S. at the federal, state, local, and nonprofit levels. It will provide a working understanding of how to develop and apply “useful measures that are used” – a simple statement that is devilishly difficult to actually do, but is fundamental for every public manager to be successful. The goal is to develop your tacit knowledge --in addition to explicit knowledge --about public sector organizational performance management. This will be done via readings, discussion, jointly developing a “playbook” of tools for performance management, and jointly developing an assessment of the Biden Administration’s approach to performance management in federal agencies via their two-year Agency Priority Goals (fiscal years 2022-2023). Learning Objectives The overall objective of this course is for you to develop a working understanding of performance management systems that you can apply as a leader in various organizational settings in the public sector. More specifically, you will be able to: • Understand the evolution of the performance management movement in the U.S. and how it fits into broader public management reforms. • Understand and apply key concepts and terms. • Understand key practices in developing and using performance information and evidence in decision making and improving performance. • Develop an understanding of how to assess the strengths and weaknesses of different performance models; and how they link to other management systems in an organization. • Identify and use resources and networks to support a performance management initiative with which you may be involved. In addition, you will: • Develop critical thinking skills that will support evidence-based decision-making in the public sector, by assessing an organization’s existing performance management framework and developing a plan for improvements, and • Demonstrate your ability to write clear memoranda and deliver effective presentations, individually and in groups. Methods of Instruction • Readings and videos in advance of class, to be posted on Moodle • Use of an On-line Discussion Forum, based on weekly readings prior to class, via Moodle • Live-synchronous class sessions via Zoom • Guest lectures via Zoom • Written and class presentation assignments – both individual and team, via Zoom • Serving as a session co-moderator, via Zoom. Weekly live, on-line sessions are 2.5 hours in length and will be broken into two segments, with a break about halfway through. You will be asked to sign up a couple of times to be a co-moderator for either the first or second segment of a session, and your chosen date. See Addendum B (below) for a description of what this role entails, and to sign up for two slots. Course Requirements and Grading The components of each student’s grade for this course will be as follows: 1. Participation and quality of contributions in on-line Discussion Forum and In-Class Discussions (30%) 2. Service as Co-Moderator, for two session segments (10%) 3. Preparation of two Memos on, and a class Oral Presentation/Discussion of, a “Performance Tool” (~ 3 pages each, written to an organization’s leadership – not a traditional academic paper --with an accompanying PowerPoint of 3-5 slides; draft and final) (30%) 4. Your Team Contributions in the development and presentation of an “Assessment of a Federal Agency’s Priority Goals” (a 7-10 page assessment memo to that agency’s particular U.S. House of Representatives oversight committee’s leadership; and an Oral Presentation/Discussion in class) (30%) Your final grade will be evaluated according to the following scale: A Exceptional work with major effort and analysis sustained and material well-written and presented (95-100%) A -Excellent work with few problems or questions, almost “A” (90-94%) B+ Competent work with insights beyond simple understanding yet lacking in effort/results to be considered “A” work (85-89%) B Proficient understanding of basic material, acceptable level of work (81-84%) B-or below Marginal level of work, demonstrated gaps in understanding or lack of comprehension of the material at an acceptable level (80% or less) Required Materials No purchases are required, but a number of readings will draw from a new book: Marc Holzer and Andrew Ballard, Eds. (2022). The Public Productivity and Performance Handbook, 3rd Edition. New York, NY: Routledge Press. It is available via Amazon as an e-book for about $40, but I’ll be posting the authors’ manuscript versions of all required readings in Moodle as an alternative to purchasing the entire book (which has a number of other useful chapters if you think you’d like to learn more about this topic down the road). All other reading materials will be posted on Moodle or available directly via hotlinks to on-line resources. Addendum A.

How to Use On-Line Class Discussion Forum (courtesy of Professor Jane Fountain) Besides the real-time, on-line classes, the most frequent form of interaction for the course will be our discussion forum. Use it to deepen and strengthen your learning. I’m not the leader of the discussion forum, but will step in from time to time to facilitate, to ask questions, and to move us along if I think that’s needed. You are all mature learners and have your own interests and directions. Pursue them through the discussion forum. Your colleagues in the course will have ideas to share. Let’s explore what you find interesting in the course materials, what seems to be missing, what other resources and ideas you want to share, and, importantly, what are some of the practical ways forward to reduce build policies, practices and communities that serve the public interest. Don’t be afraid to differ with others, but do it respectfully and constructively. We can all learn from one another. How to Post and Comment on the Discussion Forum I'm going to assume you've done this before on Moodle and know more about it than I do, but each Class Session will have a new Discussion Forum to discuss that week’s required review materials. You are expected to add your own 250-300 word contribution as a “New Discussion Topic.” Please do this by Noon on the Friday before the Class meets. This will give you and your classmates time to read and respond to each others’ written insights. Please complete your comments on others’ posts by 5:00 p.m. on the Monday before our Tuesday Class meeting. (comments on the Forum app are called “Replies”). That will give the co-moderator and myself time to review and digest the posts and comments in advance of the class session. These posts and comments will become the launch point for in-class discussions that will follow. Some suggested formatting of your posts: • Title the post with the class session and your descriptive heading (e.g., Session 2: Why Should Context Matter?). A good heading should invite others to click on your post and read/respond. And by labeling with the class session, I can better distinguish one week from another when I read your posts across the entire semester. • Your posts should be broken into short paragraphs. A single blob of text is uninviting to read – in class and in the real world you’ll be working in eventually. • Focus on a single topic; don’t try to cover everything in the readings. you can better articulate your insights by selecting a theme and focusing. Discussion Forum: Criteria for Grading (30% of total grade) A+ -Frequent posts (substantially above the minimum requirement of 2 per session) and all postings are insightful, critically developed and contribute positively to the "class discussion." Posting early, before the deadline, is encouraged in order to promote further discussion and inquiry by classmates, and will be a grading factor. A-– Number of postings are above the minimum number and they are insightful, critically developed and contribute positively to the class discussion. Postings are done by the deadline thereby promoting further discussion and inquiry by classmates. B+ -Few postings (just meeting the minimum requirement). Postings do not offer any insight to the discussions or readings. They are general comments and opinions that are not critically developed. B -The minimum number of postings is not met and some units are missed. The postings in general only make an occasional reference to the assignment, readings or discussion preventing further discussion or questions. Responses to other students’ postings are not positive and they lack insightful comments limiting further discussion. C -Consistent failure to maintain the minimum number of postings and having missed units. Postings are not organized nor developed, and inappropriate comments are made. Responses to other students' postings are not consistent and they do not add to the discussion nor raise new questions. Discussion Forum Etiquette • Be thoughtful. Include something new in your reply. For example, include more than “I do not agree” or “Good point.” State why you agree or disagree. Be considerate of the points made by others. • Be concise. Keep posts short. Include web addresses or attachments where necessary. • Stay on the topic. Make sure your message fits within the general topic of the forum. If it does not, look for a suitable forum. • Include a descriptive subject. Make threads easy to follow by using accurate and descriptive subject lines. • Create new threads as needed. If your message will take the current thread’s topic in a new direction, start a new thread. • Use plain English. Use simple, conversational, uncomplicated language. Remember, your audience is reading onscreen and may have several messages to read. Also, English may not be the first language of all participants. I don’t anticipate rudeness or unacceptable behavior on our discussion forums. But this is not a Reddit forum or a social media opportunity for snark. In the end, this is an academic space devoted to your learning and development. So, it needs to a safe space where people can try out ideas and receive constructive, useful, specific feedback. Providing this feedback is an art and a professional skill that is well worth your time to develop. B. Sign-Up Sheet and Instructions for Your Role as a Co-Moderator Because this course is on-line and interactive, I’m asking each of you to play a role in supporting both the technical component as well as the discussion component of the on-line class. Please sign up to serve in this role twice during the semester. • Each class session will have two co-moderators. One will be the lead support the first Part; the other will lead support for the second Part. • The co-moderators will help lead class discussions on designated topics each week, and monitor time of presenters to ensure they don’t run over their time. • Those who lead discussions on class Discussion Forum posts will need to read the discussion forum posts on the readings required in advance of class. That individual will be exempt from having to prepare posts/responses for that class session. • Meet on-line jointly with instructor prior to the on-line classroom session for which you have signed-up to help moderate, to discuss class flow. C. Sign-Up Sheet and Instructions for Individual Assignments: Memos on a Performance Tool or Technique Contents of Individual Presentations: Prepare your material in the form of a memo to an agency leader that describes your selected performance tool as if it is under consideration for adoption in that agency. The product of your research should be: (1) a 3-4 page memo (about 1,000 – 1,300 words, single space) to your Agency Head on a selected technique or tool that includes at least 3-5 references/citations where readers can learn more. (These citations should not be to Wikipedia); (2) a 5-minute oral presentation with 3-5 slides; (3) respond to class questions for an additional 5 minutes; and (4) develop a revised memo based on feedback that will then be included in a final “tool box” of memos to be posted on the web. Your memo and presentation should address topics such as: What is it? When developed? Who/where developed? Describe how it works/ is used. What is its relation to other tools/techniques within a broader performance management framework? Your assessment of its usefulness in different scenarios. Pluses/ minuses of the tool/technique. We will discuss in class the use of a common format (for the revised memo) once we see a useful pattern. Following is a list of tools to choose from. Select two (2) that no one else has selected. Presentations will be on the dates listed below: Topics to Choose Among: Presentations at Session 2 (February 14): Creating a Performance Context • Key National Indicators • Backcasting • Enterprise Risk Management Presentations at Session 3 (February 21): Alternatives for Informing a Performance Framework • Logic Model • Lean Six Sigma • Balanced Scorecard • ISO-9000 Standards • Baldrige Quality Award Criteria Presentations at Session 5 (March 7): Using Data & Evidence to Inform Decisions • Performance Budgeting/Results-Based Budgeting • Activity Based Costing • Program Assessment Rating Tool • Agency Strategic Reviews Presentations at Session 6 (March 21): Using Data & Evidence to Improve Performance • PerformanceStat • Agile • Benchmarking • Best Practices • Performance Dashboards • GIS/Visualization Tools Presentations at Session 7 (March 28): Creating Incentives and Accountability for Performance • Performance Agreements • Performance-Based Pay • Performance-Based Contracting • Performance-Based Grants • Performance-based Regulations Presentations at Session 8 (April 4): Using Evidence & Evaluation Techniques • Social Impact Bonds/Pay for Results • Randomized Control Trials • Tiered Evidence Grants • Learning Agendas • Social Equity Measures Your presentation date will be treated as your first draft for your memo. Based on feedback from the discussion, your final memos will be due two weeks after your class presentation. D. Instructions for Team Assignment Memo: Assessing a Federal Agency’s Priority Goals The Team Assignment Memo will be to assess a federal agency’s two-year Priority Goals for fiscal years 2022-2023 (October 2021 – September 2023). These goals, and their quarterly progress updates, are published on a central website, www.performance.gov. The updates lag by one quarter (e.g., the quarter ending Dec 31 will be published around March 31). Overview Each team will be comprised of two people. You can select who you would like to work with and which agency you would jointly like to review from a list of the 24 major departments and agencies (see below; I’ve deleted several for reasons I can explain later). The team goal is to serve as an analytic team from GAO (or an outside group, like Results for America) that provides an outside assessment of the goals against a set of criteria (to be developed by the class). You will then summarize your assessment and draft a memo to the U.S. House Committee Chair and Ranking Minority Member that has oversight of that agency. You will then use PowerPoint to present the contents of the draft to the full class in a briefing for discussion and then have an opportunity afterwards to fine tune the memo into a final document to be submitted to the instructor. Presentations will be on May 2. Contents of Memo to House Committee Leadership and PowerPoint Presentation to Class: • 7-10 page memo to the House Committee Chair and Ranking Minority Member (about 2,500 – 3,500 words, single spaced) Background Overview of Agency (~ 2 pages): • Agency size, mission, $, staff size (FTEs), field office presence • Summary list of Agency Priority Goals, with brief descriptions Analytic Assessment & Recommendations (balance of memo): • Apply the jointly develop assessment criteria for use by all teams • Revise draft memo to include cross-agency assessments after listening to each others’ presentations/papers (if you think that would be appropriate) • Recommendations for improvement to the Committee (The Timetable for signing up for a specific agency will be by March 21, the class session after Spring Break) List of Federal Agencies to Choose Among Department of Agriculture  Department of State / U.S. Agency for International Development (2 agencies)  Department of Commerce  Department of Transportation  Department of Defense  Department of the Treasury  Department of Education  Department of Veterans Affairs  Department of Energy  Environmental Protection Agency  Department of Health and Human Services  General Services Administration  Department of Homeland Security  National Aeronautics and Space Administration  Department of Housing and Urban Development  National Science Foundation  Department of the Interior  Office of Personnel Management  Department of Justice  Small Business Administration  Department of Labor  Social Security Administration  E. Campus Policies and Support I want you to be successful in this course. This course is meant to meet you where you are. We all come to the program and courses with different strengths and needs. Feel free to talk with me about learning concerns and other matters related to your ability to make the most of this course and your professional development. I am happy to serve as a resource to you or to refer you to more knowledgeable sources. We are living through a highly uncertain time that is affecting individuals very differently. Accommodation Policy Statement. Please let me know if you need any accommodations to make the course accessible to you. The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to making reasonable, effective and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of students with disabilities and help create a barrier-free campus. If you have a disability and require accommodations, please register with Disability Services (161 Whitmore Administration building; phone 413-545-0892) to have an accommodation letter sent to your faculty. Information on services and materials for registering are also available on their website www.umass.edu/disability. Identity. You have the right to have your chosen name and pronouns respected and used throughout the class. It may seem obvious, but learning people’s names --meaning what they prefer to be called --and using them is a core professional (and human) skill. The class roster in Spire lists your name --either legal first name or a preferred first name that has been entered in Spire. You may also enter the pronouns by which they would like to be referred in Spire. My pronouns are she/her. Policies and resources regarding gender identity are here: https://www.umass.edu/stonewall/ A useful, practical article is here: https://www.npr.org/2021/06/02/996319297/gender-identity-pronouns-expression-guide.lgbtq Title IX. If you have been the victim of sexual violence, gender discrimination, or sexual harassment, the university can provide you with a variety of support resources and accommodations. UMass is committed to providing these resources with minimal impact and costs to survivors on a case-by-case basis. Resources are available to survivors with or without them filing a complaint. No upfront costs are charged to any currently enrolled students for University Health Services or the Center for Counseling and Psychological Health, and no fees exist for services in the Dean of Students Office, the Center for Women and Community, Student Legal Services, or by live-in residential staff. Mental Health. We are living in a particularly stressful and anxiety-producing time. Please reach out if you feel that you’re falling behind or unable to do your work. The campus has excellent resources to help students and others cope with stress, anxiety, and other challenges to psychological wellbeing. Policies and resources: https://www.umass.edu/counseling/ . Please put your physical and mental health first and find ways to engage in self care as well as care for those you are close to. Graduate programs are inherently stressful because they invite growth and development but require a great deal of work. Statement on Academic Honesty. Be sure that any writing you produce does not inadvertently use the material of others. Be sure you follow this guidance throughout your professional career. See University guidelines on citing sources or check with me. We use a variety of online tools to compare written work by students with text available on the Internet. Plagiarism is a serious offense in education and in professional life. I have rarely encountered it in my classes and don’t expect to. It is expected that all graduate students will abide by the Academic Honesty Policy (pp. 9-10 of the document available here). Sanctions for acts of dishonesty range from receiving a grade of F on the paper/exam/assignment or in the course, loss of funding, being placed on probation or suspension for a period of time, or being dismissed from the University. All students have the right of appeal through the Academic Honesty Board. See the useful set of resources at “How Do I Know if I’m Plagiarizing?” at https://www.umass.edu/academichonesty/HowDoIKnow.html Additional policies and resources: https://www.umass.edu/academichonesty/index.html; https://www.umass.edu/honesty/ Class Policy on Use of Artificial Intelligence. (based on Ethan Mollick’s policy, Wharton School) You can use AI in this class (e.g., ChatGPT and image generation tools). Learning to use AI is an emerging skill in the future workplace, so you should learn its benefits and limits. Since most of these tools are still in the development phase, there are many limits to be aware of: • If you provide minimum or vague prompts, you will get low quality results. Developing good prompts will take thought and work. • Don’t trust anything it says. If it gives you a number or fact, assume it is wrong unless either you know the answer or can check with another source. It works best for topics you already thoroughly understand. • You need to acknowledge when you are using the tool. If you use it, please add a page at the end of your assignment that describes the prompts you used to get your results, and how you verified the information. Failure to do so is a violation of academic honesty policies. Other Campus Resources. The campus has developed these resources to help you to be successful during your time at UMass Amherst.
