[Required chapters/sections will be posted on Moodle as PDFs] Course Description How does development influence evolution? This simple question has inspired evolutionary biologists since Darwin, who recognized that species-specific shapes often arise during embryogenesis. We can think of evolution as consisting of two steps: (1) the generation of organismic variation, and (2) the differential survival of variants within a population. The “Modern Synthesis” of the 1930s and 1940s united evolutionary biology and Mendelian genetics to explain the origin and maintenance of adaptive variation within populations/species. It’s focus, in other words, was on step 2, or the “survival of the fittest.” The Modern Synthesis could not, however, identify the specific genetic changes that underlie evolutionary change, nor could it account for major evolutionary transitions. Evolutionary developmental biology (aka: ‘evo-devo’) seeks to complement the Modern Synthesis by identifying the developmental genetic changes that underlie evolution. The emphasis of evo-devo is on step 1, or the “arrival of the fittest,” and is grounded by the idea that changes in evolution are caused by heritable changes in development. Evo-devo is motivated by questions that have been asked by biologists for hundreds of years: How does development produce complex structures (e.g., wings, fins, heads and flowers) from a single cell zygote? How has natural selection acted on the developmental program to produce adaptive phenotypic variation? What goes wrong in development when disease occurs? For centuries these basic questions have gone unanswered. Significant technological advances in genomics and developmental genetics (including gene/genome editing) now allow biologists to understand how genes control development, and how development drives (or limits!) evolution. Indeed, these advances are so significant, that it is now possible to contemplate altering the course of evolution (e.g., de-extinction). We will explore such topics and questions this semester. Learning Goals Knowledge Outcomes: On completing this course you should have a solid understanding of (a) evolutionary patterns and processes (e.g., homology at different levels of biological organization), (b) developmental logic, (c) principals of gene regulation (e.g., enhancers and their role in development and evolution), and (d) the “rules” that permit and limit evolutionary change. In addition, you should be comfortable reading and processing the primary scientific literature, as well as distilling and communicating information gleaned from these sources. In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin referred to “endless forms most beautiful” when describing the biodiversity that surrounds us. I want you to come away from this class, quite simply, with an appreciation for how these endless forms have come to be – e.g., how development makes a limb, how snakes lost their limbs, how the bat got its wing, etc. Course Format I. General Each week’s assigned readings will be available for download from Moodle the previous Friday, and lectures (.pptx) will be available for review the evening before class. Attendance is expected. You will not be able to obtain all of the necessary information from the lecture slides or readings alone. II. Quizzes Many class meetings will begin with a short quiz that will cover that day’s assigned readings. Quizzes will be i>clicker based and there will be 14 of them. Assigned readings should therefore be done before class! There will be no make-up quizzes. Instead, I will drop your 4 lowest quiz grades. Thus, your final quiz grade will be based on 10 quizzes. III. Exams You will have three exams over the course of the semester. They will not be cumulative. I will provide more information about these as they near. IV.Creatively scientific writing This is your final assignment where you will show off everything that you have learned over the semester: Build me a hypothetical animal – a “hopeful monster”. Tell me where this animal lives and how it is adapted to its environment. Most importantly, you should be able to connect the dots from (i) genetic alterations/ mutations, (ii) through morphogenesis, (iii) to the production of the phenotype. While a creative exercise, you will be evaluated based on the science behind your “story”. As such, this endeavor should be scientifically grounded and based on real processes (use citations!). Convince me that this could happen -e.g., you must be mindful of the rules of development and evolution. The paper should be no more than 5 pages (1.5 line spacing, excluding references or figures/illustrations). We will dedicate time in the lab to discuss your papers and tips for how to select and research traits that you will endow your creature with (you need at least 3). You will also turn in an annotated bibliography (9+ references minimum — 3/trait) before the Thanksgiving break. I will provide critical feedback, and the exercise will contribute 5% of your total course grade. V.Laboratory section There will be a 1 credit (3 hour/week) laboratory section associated with this class. Herein we will explore the development and evolution of an important novelty – the vertebrate jaw. In particular, we will use the jaw as a paradigm in which to explore the concepts of “modularity” and “individualization” in the development and evolution of animal body plans. In the lab, you will be guided through a series of exercises that will expose you to the integrative nature of evo-devo, and allow you to gain practical experience in a wide range of techniques used in the field, from experimental embryology to statistical shape analyses. Most meetings will begin with a brief lecture, and/or review of the day’s assigned reading, followed by a “hands on” exercise. Broadly, the lab will be divided into 3 themes: Anatomy, Development and Evolution. Following an initial survey of skull diversity across vertebrates, we will explore the developmental origins and pattering of the jaw skeleton using a popular animal model – the zebrafish. The semester will end with an analysis of co-evolution of different skeletal elements across a particularly successful group of fishes — cichlids from East Africa. Details of your lab grade will be provided in lab. Attendance Policies Lecture – Formal attendance will not be taken; however, it will be important to attend all lectures to gain a full and comprehensive understanding of the material. Readings and posted lecture slides are intended to supplement, not replace, my lectures. Lab – Formal attendance will note be taken; however, a significant proportion of your lab grade will be based on your lab notebook in which you will document the day’s activities including methods, images, data, results and interpretations. Grading This course seeks to measure your abilities to absorb new concepts, while also focusing on your abilities to integrate and communicate what you have learned. Each component will be weighted as follows: Quizzes:  (10 x 1%)  10% (contribution to final grade)  Exams:  (3 x 11%)  33% (contribution to final grade)  Paper:  (5% bibliography + 30% final)  35% (contribution to final grade)  Lab:  22% (contribution to final grade)  100%  Grading scale  100-93  A  92.99-90  A. 89.99-88  B+  87.99-83  B  82.99-80  B. 79.99-78  C+  77.99-73  C  72.99-70  C. 69.99-68  D+  67.99-63  D  62.99-60  D- Below 60  F  Course Schedule WEEK 1: INTRO & OVERVIEW OF EVO-DEVO & A BRIEF HISTORY OF ANIMALS September 6 – Welcome & Introduction!

For the final paper, you are welcome to discuss your ideas and references with each other, but each of you must write your own paper without assistance. Please see me, if you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism, or the proper use and crediting of primary literature. Violations of the academic honesty policy will be reported to the Academic Honesty Office, and result in a zero grade for the assignment. Beyond plagiarism, quoting published material should be kept to a minimum, ideally never. I am not interested in what others have to say on a topic, but rather what you have to say. Excessive quoting will lead to the loss of points (and generally put me in a bad mood). Your final paper will be submitted via Turnitin. Submitted assignments will be included in the UMass Amherst dedicated database of assignments at Turnitin, and will be used solely for the purpose of checking for possible plagiarism during the grading process during this term and in the future. Accommodation Policy I am committed to providing equal educational opportunities and fair assessments for all students, and will work with Disability Services and students to arrange appropriate accommodations for student needs. My ability to do this depends on being informed of student needs as soon as possible, ideally within the first 2 weeks of the semester. It is the student’s responsibility to inform instructors of their needs with sufficient time for accommodations to be arranged.
