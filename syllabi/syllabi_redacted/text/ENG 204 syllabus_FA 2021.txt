ENG 204  Instructor:  Prof. <PROF_FULL_NAME>  Fall 2021  (she/her)  TTh 11:30 a.m. -12:45 p.m.  Email:  <PROF_EMAIL>  W201 South College  Office:  W341 South College  Introduction to Asian American Literature Course Description Organized around the development of Asian American studies as an academic discipline that sought to challenge white supremacy, this class will introduce students to several canonical texts in Asian American literature as well as contemporary cultural productions that contribute to and complicate what it means to be “Asian American.” Our reading practice will consist of contextualizing the texts in their historical production, as well using close-reading and critical thinking in order to study how identities are produced in a given historical moment in different relationships to structures of power such as US imperialism, racism, capitalism, patriarchy, and heteronormativity. The ultimate goal of this class is not to impart an empirical knowledge on what it means to be Asian American but to destabilize such knowledge, through a study of changing representations. Required Texts 1. Carlos Bulosan, America Is in the Heart * 2. John Okada, No-No Boy 3. Maxine Hong Kingston, The Woman Warrior* 4. Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do 5. Ocean Vuong, Night Sky with Exit Wounds 6. Franny Choi, Soft Science * Available on Moodle. You are required to bring all assigned readings to class (either in paper or electronic format) on the day that they are listed on the syllabus. GRADING AND COURSE REQUIREMENTS Attendance & Class Participation 15% Reading Exercises 15% Discussion Question & Facilitation 10% SCAP (2-3 pages) 15% Group Presentation 15% Final Project 30% Attendance & Class Participation (15%): Because this class will be run as a seminar, everyone’s active participation will be vital to its success. • You are allowed two unexcused absences; after that, your final grade will be lowered for every additional unexcused absence (B becomes a B-). • If you arrive 10 minutes late more than 3 times, this will count as an unexcused absence. • Five or more unexcused absences will result in a failing course grade. Participation includes: • Coming to class on time. Chronic lateness and/or leaving early will also have a negative impact on your grade. • Doing the assigned reading and contributing thoughtfully to discussions by talking and listening respectfully. • Turning off or silencing your cell phone. Computers and other electronic equipment should be used for class purposes only. Reading Exercises (15%): There will be routine quizzes, writing assignments, and Moodle posts related to the reading for the day. Sometimes I will ask you to write a short piece or upload a Moodle post for the next class. I may also give out a reading quiz at the beginning of a class. You will not be able to make up the quiz if you are late or absent. Discussion Questions & Facilitation (10%): You will sign up to come up with a discussion question based on the day’s reading(s) and post it on Moodle before the class meeting. Once in class, you will introduce and facilitate the discussion that results from the question. Your question should be about 100-words and be conducive to a discussion. Here is an example that is 103 words: I am interested in how the simile of a child functions as a literary device in Bret Harte’s construction of his Chinese character Ah Sin in “Plain Language.” The narrator, James, describes Ah Sin as “child-like.” What are the characteristics from the poem that support that description, and what are some assumptions or biases that are revealed through it? Isn’t it offensive to describe a grown man as “child-like”? Or, are we meant to take it as a “positive” description that renders Ah Sin harmless or innocent? If so, how does the descriptor complicate the derogatory label of Ah Sin as “heathen Chinee”? Short Critical Analysis Paper (SCAP) (15%):  You will write a short critical analysis paper (SCAP) that showcases your close reading skills and knowledge of the text’s context in Asian American history. See the SCAP handout and Paper Rubric for details. Group Presentation (15%): In a group of 5-6, you will provide the historical context of a particular text. See the Group Presentation Handout for details. Final Project (30%): You will have the option of either working individually or in a group for your final project. You also have the option to write a research paper or do a creative project (e.g. write a short story, produce a short film, etc.). You will give a 5-minute presentation of your project at the end of the semester. See the Final Project Handout for details. Extra Credit: You may attend up to two public or on-line events relevant to the class and submit a typed, one-page, single-spaced report for each event. The events must be announced by me in class or via email. It should have one paragraph summarizing and describing the event and another paragraph critiquing and evaluating it. The report should be submitted on Moodle, no later than one week after the date of the event. If you have five or more unexcused absences in the class, or if you have been suspected of plagiarism, you will be disqualified from receiving any extra credit. LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED, unless under exceptional circumstances. You must complete all assignments in order to pass this class. No incompletes will be given for this class. ADMINSTRATIVE DETAILS AND GUIDELINES Campus & Class Policy on PlagiarismThe University of Massachusetts has high standards of academic integrity, which I uphold. (See For the University’s definition of “academic dishonesty,” see the document Academic Honesty Policy & Procedure (https://www.umass.edu/honesty/). https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/downloads/AcademicHonestyPolicy.pdf). To use phrases and/or ideas from any other source as if they were your own constitutes plagiarism. Submitting your own work for more than one course without permission of both instructors can also constitutes plagiarism. The University Code of Student Conduct specifies that ignorance of these standards is not an excuse. All students in this class should familiarize themselves with the library’s guidelines on avoiding plagiarism at http://guides.library.umass.edu/content.php?pid=9697&sid=63876. If you have questions about fair use or documentation, please do not hesitate to consult me. Plagiarism will result in, at minimum, an automatic zero on the assignment and a failing participation grade. Class Policy on Notes Per university policy, class notes are for your own personal use, and video and audio recording of class is prohibited without express permission of the instructor. Email EtiquetteIn addition to my office hours, feel free to email me with questions or concerns about the class.
