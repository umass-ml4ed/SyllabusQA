Specifically,they	willdevelop	thestatisticaland	programming	expertise	necessary	to	analyze	datasets	with	complexrelationshipsbetween	variables. Students	willgain	hands-on	experience	analyzingdatausingsimple/multiplelinear	regression,	logistic	regression,	Poisson	regression	and	an	introduction	to	machine	learning.	Students	willlearn	howtobuildstatisticalmodels	thatcan	be	usedtodescribe	andevaluate multidimensionalrelationships	thatexistin	the	realworld. Students	willwork	withthe	Rstatisticalcomputinglanguageandbytheendofthecoursewillrequiresubstantialindependent	programming. The course will not provide explicit or detailed training in R programming. To	the	extent	possible,	the	course	will	draw	on	real	datasets	from	biological	and	biomedicalapplications. Thiscourse	isdesigned	forstudentswho	are	lookingforasecond	course	inappliedstatistics/biostatistics (e.g. beyond PUBHLTH 460), or an accelerated introduction to statistics	 andmodern	statisticalcomputing. LearningGoals(By the end of the course students will be able to...) – usedatatoidentifyanddistinguishpatternsofrandomnessvs. non-randomness, – understand	and	critique	statisticalmodelequations	as	representations	of	a	given	real-world	setting, – formulate,fit,andinterpretstatisticalmodelstodesignedtoanswerspecific	scientificquestions, – weighevidencefor/againsthypothesesaboutassociationsbetweenvariables, – diagnosetheappropriatenessor“goodness-of-fit”ofagivenmodel, – writeconcise,professional,andreproduciblestatisticalanalysisreports. LectureNotes Lectureslideswillbeavailableonthecoursewebsite. Text PUBHLTH 490Z will use the draft text Introductory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences, a revision of OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd ed. The revision is tailored for undergraduate	 studentsinthelifesciences. AlsoincludedisanRcompanionforintroductorystatistics.
