FS542-Food Chemistry II: minor components and food additives Instructor: <PROF_FULL_NAME>, 344 chenoweth lab., office phone: <PHONE> Email: <PROF_EMAIL> Office hour: by appointment Expected Outcomes: 1. To develop an understanding of the fundamental chemistry of food minor components (e.g. minerals, vitamins, nutraceuticals), direct food additives (e.g. colors, flavors, preservatives, texture modifiers & stabilizers), incidental food additives (e.g. processing aids, chemical toxins), intentional adulterants, allergens etc. 2. To develop an understanding of the key functional attributes of minor food components, direct and incidental food additives of how they contribute to the overall quality attributes such as nutrition, flavor, texture, stability, and appearance and safety attributes.  3. To be able to utilize knowledge of food chemistry to improve the quality, diversity, convenience, safety, and healthfulness of the food supply. Expected Knowledge: Organic chemistry is required and FS541-Food chemistry I is preferred. Textbooks: Introductory Food Chemistry (optional).

Each quiz will be open for 48 hours. Late submission will have 50% off. Overdue 3 days will receive 0. Homework -(deadline 11/3, 11:59pm) Find a package of your favorite food (ingredient list no less than 15) and list the function(s) of all the ingredients. If you find the food additives that are not covered in the class. Please list chemical name of the additive, its function, chemistry, and applications in food products. Homework will be discussed and graded in class by peers. You must attend the class to receive the grade. If you are not able to attend the class due to excusable reasons, you need to inform the instructor ahead of time. Exams: middle and final exams are both online open book exam at designated time (48 hours). For students that are not able to attend at the designated time due to excusable reasons (such as being sick with a doctor’s note, or having 4 other exams during the 48 hours with instructor’s proof), upon approval, make-up exams will be scheduled with a set of different questions. You need to inform the instructor ahead of time. Middle exam: Oct 21th (10:10am)-Oct 23th (10:10am), Late submission will have 50% off.
