A small percentage of our classes will be virtual for everyone, as is allowed by state policies. The remainder of our class meetings will be held only face-to.face. It is important that you attend class meetings, as this course is based around learning by participating in live activities and discussions. Fully-documented university-excused absences are not penalized. However, I understand that life is complicated sometimes in ways that university-excused absences do not capture. You can miss one class meeting with no penalty and no documentation needed, as long as you complete all classwork assignments for that day's module on Canvas. Please inform me via email prior to missing a class meeting. You do not need to give a reason why. If you think you will miss more than one class, please let me know (email is fine), and we can together come to an arrangement that makes sense in your situation and allows you to be successful. Note that when you attend a class, your classwork assignment turn-in on Canvas for the day will usually be your written solutions to or discussion of one activity we did. However, if you miss the class meeting, you must turn in your solutions to and discussion of all activities done during that class meeting's module as your turn-in on Canvas. If you miss 3 or more in-person class meetings (assuming the course meets once per week for a regular semester), the instructor reserves the right to assign an F as your grade in the course. This number is 6 if the course meets twice a week for a regular semester, and 9 if the course meets three times a week for a regular semester. Statement on Communication You may contact the instructor via SMU email or the Canvas inbox. During the work week, the instructor will respond to your question or email within 48 hours. The instructor does not typically respond to emails on holidays and weekends. Assignments will be graded within 1 week of the assignment due date. This grading timeline might be delayed for long essays and complex projects. Policy on Use of Generative AI on Class Assignments You may responsibly use Generative AI programs, such as Chat-GPT, to assist you in completing any of the assignments in this course. All assignments are designed so that a program like Chat-GPT could provide a useful outline or starting draft, but such that the program would not be able to get a passing grade on its own if it completed the assignment. You as the student take full responsibility for the impact of any errors that the generative AI makes in its responses on your assignmentÕs grade. You also take full responsibility on issues of bias related to the use of generative AI, and their impact on your assignmentÕs grade. Title IX and Disability Accommodations Disability Accommodations Students who need academic accommodations for a disability must first register with Disability Accommodations & Success Strategies (DASS). Students can call <PHONE> or visit smu.edu/DASS to begin the process. Once they are registered and approved, students then submit a DASS Accommodation Letter through the electronic portal, DASS Link, and then communicate directly with each of their instructors to make appropriate arrangements. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive, but rather require advance notice in order to implement. Sexual Harassment All forms of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking, are violations of SMUÕs Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy and may also violate Texas law. Students who wish to file a complaint or to receive more information about the grievance process may contact Samantha Thomas, SMUÕs Title IX Coordinator, at <EMAIL> or <PHONE>. Please note that faculty and staff are mandatory reporters. If students notify faculty or staff of sexual harassment, they must report it to the Title IX Coordinator. For more information about sexual harassment, including resources available to assist students, please visit smu.edu/sexualmisconduct. Pregnant and Parenting Students Under Title IX, students who are pregnant or parenting may request academic adjustments by contacting the Office of Student Advocacy and Support by calling <PHONE>. Students seeking assistance must schedule an appointment with their professors as early as possible, present a letter from the Office of the Dean of Students, and make appropriate arrangements. Please note that academic adjustments are not retroactive and, when feasible, require advance notice to implement. Academic Policies Religious Observance Religiously observant students wishing to be absent on holidays that require missing class should notify their professors in writing at the beginning of the semester and should discuss with them, in advance, acceptable ways of making up any work missed because of the absence. Click here for a list of holidays. Medical-Related Absences To ensure academic continuity and avoid any course penalties, students should follow procedures described by their instructors in order to be provided with appropriate modifications to assignments, deadlines, and exams. Excused Absences for University Extracurricular Activities Students participating in an officially sanctioned, scheduled university extracurricular activity should be given the opportunity to make up class assignments or other graded assignments that were missed as a result of their participation. It is the responsibility of the student to make arrangements for make-up work with the instructor prior to any missed scheduled examinations or other missed assignments. (See current Catalog under heading of "Academic Records/Excused Absences.") Final Exams Final course examinations shall be given in all courses where appropriate, and some form of final assessment is essential. Final exams and assessments must be administered as specified in the official examination schedule. Exams cannot be administered or due during the last week of classes or during the Reading Period. Syllabi must state clearly the form of the final exam or assessment, and the due date and time must match the official SMU exam schedule. Final exams are not required to be provided online. Academic Dishonesty Students are expected to embrace and uphold the SMU Honor Code. Violations of the Honor Code will be acted upon in accordance with the policies and procedures outlined in the Mustang Student Handbook. Student Support Services Student Academic Success Programs Students needing assistance with writing assignments for SMU courses may schedule an appointment with the Writing Center through Canvas. Students who would like support for subject-specific tutoring or success strategies should contact SASP, Loyd All Sports Center, Suite 202; <PHONE>; smu.edu/sasp. Caring Community Connections Program CCC is a resource for anyone in the SMU community to refer students of concern to the Office of the Dean of Students. The online referral form can be found at smu.edu/deanofstudentsccc. After a referral form is submitted, students will be contacted to discuss the concern, strategize options, and be connected to appropriate resources. Anyone who is unclear about what steps to take if they have concerns about students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at <PHONE>. Mental Health Resources: On-Call and Ongoing Counseling Services Throughout the academic year, students may encounter different stressors or go through life experiences which impact their mental health and academic performance. Students who are in distress or have concerns about their mental health can schedule a same-day or next-day appointment to speak with a counselor by calling Counseling Services. Counselors are available at any time, day or night for students in crisis at this number: <PHONE> (then select option 2) They will be connected with a counselor immediately. Students seeking ongoing counseling should call the same number (<PHONE>, then select option 1) during normal business hours to schedule an initial appointment. Campus Carry Law In accordance with Texas Senate Bill 11, also known as the Ôcampus carryÕ law, and following consultation with entire University community, SMU chooses to remain a weapons-free campus. Specifically, SMU prohibits possession of weapons (either openly or in a concealed manner) on campus. For more information, please see: smu.edu/campuscarrylaw. Assignments Assessment of student performance on course objectives and content is determined by the following activities and assignments. Assignments  Percent of Grade  Homework: Mini-Lessons, Discussion Board  20  Cognitive Interview Project  15  Classwork  20  Midterm Examination Project  20  Final Examination Project  25  Total  100  1. Homework Assignments (20% of grade): a. TD Reading Activities: When you read sections from your TD textbook on topics like fractions or Base-10, you will be asked to design your own unique mini-activity on each topic for elementary students in your desired grade level. These activities should be based on the principles and research covered in the reading, but should be original to you and your future classroom. You may use generative AI to get ideas, but the lesson plans will not be awarded credit unless they reference specific pages and passages from the weekly reading. You will present your activity to the class each week. b. Discussion Board Reflections: We will also be reading chapters from BMT and other books. You will be asked to write a reflection on each of these reading assignments and post it on the discussion board. You will also be asked to respond to the reflections of two other class members. 2. Classwork (20% of grade) Various classwork assignments will be given during class. Your work on these assignments may be submitted on paper, or via google docs/sheets/slides, or as a submission on Canvas. 3. Cognitive Interview Project (15% of grade) You will conduct the geometry and measurement interviews we covered in class with one student. You will submit tables (from the interview protocol) and your notes on what they did to solve each problem, as well as 2 paragraphs where you reflect and plan future instruction for that student. Remember, for the geometry interview you will need pattern blocks. For the measurement interview, you will need two sizes of paperclips, square tiles, and a ruler. You can check these materials out from me. Measurement Interview Protocol Geometry Interview Protocol 4. Midterm Examination Project (20% of Grade) Undergraduate Students: Design an original Mathigon activity related to Geometry, Measurement, or Probability and Statistics. You activity can be a short, simple warm-up activity, or a more complicated activity. Submit a link to the activity you created to the instructor, along with (1) why you decided to use Mathigon in the way you did, (2) what kinds of students and what kinds of circumstances the activity is intended to be implemented in. Masters Students: Implement an existing Mathigon activity, lesson plan, or Polypad in your classroom. You can also fulfill this project by implementing a lesson that utilizes MathigonÕs virtual manipulatives (note: students must be using the manipulatives, not just a presenting teacher). Your submission should include (1) a link to the activity/manipulatives, (2) 3 examples of student work completing the activity, and (3) a paragraph outlining how the activity went when you implemented it. If you have difficulty getting access to a classroom to implement the activity in, please see the instructor. 5. Final Examination Project (25% of Grade) Two to four students (depending on class size) will develop an ORIGINAL problem-based investigation that will be taught during our class. This must be a task that matches the ÒDoing MathematicsÓ level in the Level of Cognitive Demand framework. Each person/group will sign up for a mathematical topic on which the activity will be developed. This problem-solving activity should cover a topic from elementary mathematics, but should be complex/difficult enough to keep students in our class engaged. Examples will be provided that strike this balance. This project has the following elements (also see rubrics): a. Lesson Plan: Should include, at a minimum the following: title, concept/topic to be taught, standards, materials/resources. It must contain the step-by-step procedures Ð including the before, during, and after phases of the lesson as described in the lesson plan format in TD. b. Revised Lesson Plan: The group must revise their lesson plan based on instructor feedback. c. Presentation: The group will teach their lesson to the class on one of two presentation days. The lesson should last approximately 30 minutes. Group members will be evaluated on how well they implement a problem-based philosophy. d. Reflection: Each student will individually submit a reflection on how the lesson went (see rubric) e. Contributions Sheet: Each student will state what themselves and their group members contributed to this project. Group members who did not contribute appropriately will have a reduced grade, or in extreme circumstances will receive no credit. (For Masters students, this is a potential MasterÕs Project) Grading Scale Grades: Grades will be available through Canvas and students may access them to determine where they stand in this course at any time. Your grade will be calculated according to given assignment weights. Please make sure to check your grade book to see your instructors feedback on your projects and activities. To see in-line feedback, go to the assignment, then click on View Feedback if applicable. It is your responsibility to check for your instructor's feedback and make appropriate improvements to assignments if necessary. 94 Ð 100 = A  90 Ð 93 = A. 87 Ð 89 = B+  83 Ð 86 = B  80 Ð 82 = B. 79 = C+  77 Ð 78 = C  75 Ð 76 = C. 72 Ð 73 = D  74 = D+  70 Ð 71 = D. > 70 = F  Rubrics Rubric: Cognitive Interview Project Category  Points Possible  Gives childÕs age, grade level, and any other relevant background information about child.
