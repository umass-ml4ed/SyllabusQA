Students can expect routine writing exercises in class about the required reading and should also expect to post a roughly 100-word discussion question prior to every class to help facilitate conversation. There will also be a short critical analysis paper that will make up 15% of your final grade. In addition to these, students can also choose to write a research paper for their final project, which makes up 30% of your grade, though there are other options as well, such as producing a short film. ",
    "answer_span_1":"Reading Exercises (15%): There will be routine quizzes, writing assignments, and Moodle posts related to the reading for the day. Sometimes I will ask you to write a short piece or upload a Moodle post for the next class. I may also give out a reading quiz at the beginning of a class. You will not be able to make up the quiz if you are late or absent.",
    "answer_span_2":"Discussion Questions & Facilitation (10%): You will sign up to come up with a discussion question based on the day’s reading(s) and post it on Moodle before the class meeting. Once in class, you will introduce and facilitate the discussion that results from the question. Your question should be about 100-words and be conducive to a discussion. Here is an example that is 103 words:\nI am interested in how the simile of a child functions as a literary device in Bret Harte’s construction of his Chinese character Ah Sin in “Plain Language.” The narrator, James, describes Ah Sin as “child-like.” What are the characteristics from the poem that support that description, and what are some assumptions or biases that are revealed through it? Isn’t it offensive to describe a grown man as “child-like”? Or, are we meant to take it as a “positive” description that renders Ah Sin harmless or innocent? If so, how does the descriptor complicate the derogatory label of Ah Sin as “heathen Chinee”?",
    "answer_span_3":"Short Critical Analysis Paper (SCAP) (15%): You will write a short critical analysis paper (SCAP) that showcases your close reading skills and knowledge of the text’s context in Asian American history. See the SCAP handout and Paper Rubric for details.",
    "answer_span_4":"Final Project (30%): You will have the option of either working individually or in a group for your final project. You also have the option to write a research paper or do a creative project (e.g. write a short story, produce a short film, etc.). You will give a 5-minute presentation of your project at the end of the semester. See the Final Project Handout for details.",

How to Use On-Line Class Discussion Forum\n(courtesy of Professor Jane Fountain)\nBesides the real-time, on-line classes, the most frequent form of interaction for the course will\nbe our discussion forum. Use it to deepen and strengthen your learning.\nI’m not the leader of the discussion forum, but will step in from time to time to facilitate, to ask\nquestions, and to move us along if I think that’s needed. You are all mature learners and have\nyour own interests and directions. Pursue them through the discussion forum. Your colleagues\nin the course will have ideas to share. Let’s explore what you find interesting in the course\nmaterials, what seems to be missing, what other resources and ideas you want to share, and,\nimportantly, what are some of the practical ways forward to reduce build policies, practices and\ncommunities that serve the public interest.\nDon’t be afraid to differ with others, but do it respectfully and constructively. We can all learn\nfrom one another. ",
    "reasoning_step_2":"How to Post and Comment on the Discussion Forum\nI'm going to assume you've done this before on Moodle and know more about it than I do,\nbut each Class Session will have a new Discussion Forum to discuss that week’s required\nreview materials. You are expected to add your own 250-300 word contribution as a “New\nDiscussion Topic.” Please do this by Noon on the Friday before the Class meets. This will\ngive you and your classmates time to read and respond to each others’ written insights. ",
    "reasoning_step_3":"Please complete your comments on others’ posts by 5:00 p.m. on the Monday before our\nTuesday Class meeting. (comments on the Forum app are called “Replies”). That will give the\nco-moderator and myself time to review and digest the posts and comments in advance of the\nclass session. These posts and comments will become the launch point for in-class discussions\nthat will follow.",
    "reasoning_step_4":"Some suggested formatting of your posts:\n• Title the post with the class session and your descriptive heading (e.g., Session 2: Why\nShould Context Matter?). A good heading should invite others to click on your post and\nread\/respond. And by labeling with the class session, I can better distinguish one week\nfrom another when I read your posts across the entire semester.\n• Your posts should be broken into short paragraphs. A single blob of text is uninviting to\nread – in class and in the real world you’ll be working in eventually.\n• Focus on a single topic; don’t try to cover everything in the readings. you can better\narticulate your insights by selecting a theme and focusing.",

    "answer":"Because the mid-exam and final exam are worth the same amount of points and have the same 50% off late policy, I will use the final exam as an example. If the student maintains a near-perfect score on all materials excluding the final exam, they will receive a full 70 points (100% of a grade minus 30% final exam = 70% of remaining graded materials). If the student submits a late exam, assuming they did near-perfect on it, it will give them only 15 points (since 50% of 30 is 15). Therefore, the students final grade would be 70 + 15 = 85. This is a bit unrealistic, considering most students do not get perfect scores on everything, so it indicates how heavily the final exam impacts one's overall grade and emphasizes the importance of avoiding a late submission.

Zupick, Simulation with Arena, McGraw\nHill.\nI recommend (but do not require) obtaining a copy of the first textbook if possible, as we will be\nfollowing that book closely. The US edition or the International edition are the same as far as I can tell,\nand the 4th edition is largely similar to the 5th edition too, so all these editions can work.

This software is available\non computers in OSU Baker Systems labs, and via remote access.\nA free student version of the software is available for Windows devices and can be obtained from the\nsoftware’s website; the capabilities of this free version are sufficient for the lab, and therefore you may\nchoose to use this on your personal device to complete labs if you’d like. A Mac version is not available;\ntherefore, if you are a Mac-user, you can plan to use remote desktop to access ARENA on OSU computers\nwhen not on campus. Finally, note that while the free student version will have sufficient capabilities for\ncompleting the labs, you will likely need the full licensed version, available on Baker System computers,\nto complete the course project.",
