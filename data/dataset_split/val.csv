If so, how does the descriptor complicate the derogatory label of Ah Sin as “heathen Chinee”?",Short Critical Analysis Paper (SCAP) (15%): You will write a short critical analysis paper (SCAP) that showcases your close reading skills and knowledge of the text’s context in Asian American history.

education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is required of all
students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all
programs of the University. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to: cheating,
fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on
any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take
reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a
student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the
appropriate course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to
a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair.
Since students are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards
of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of
intent (http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/).","You will complete three exams throughout the semester. Each exam will cover the following
topics:

(courtesy of Professor Jane Fountain)
Besides the real-time, on-line classes, the most frequent form of interaction for the course will
be our discussion forum. Use it to deepen and strengthen your learning.
I’m not the leader of the discussion forum, but will step in from time to time to facilitate, to ask
questions, and to move us along if I think that’s needed. You are all mature learners and have
your own interests and directions. Pursue them through the discussion forum. Your colleagues
in the course will have ideas to share. Let’s explore what you find interesting in the course
materials, what seems to be missing, what other resources and ideas you want to share, and,
importantly, what are some of the practical ways forward to reduce build policies, practices and
communities that serve the public interest.
Don’t be afraid to differ with others, but do it respectfully and constructively. We can all learn
from one another. ","How to Post and Comment on the Discussion Forum
I'm going to assume you've done this before on Moodle and know more about it than I do,
but each Class Session will have a new Discussion Forum to discuss that week’s required
review materials. You are expected to add your own 250-300 word contribution as a “New
Discussion Topic.” Please do this by Noon on the Friday before the Class meets. This will
give you and your classmates time to read and respond to each others’ written insights. ","Please complete your comments on others’ posts by 5:00 p.m. on the Monday before our
Tuesday Class meeting. (comments on the Forum app are called “Replies”). That will give the
co-moderator and myself time to review and digest the posts and comments in advance of the
class session. These posts and comments will become the launch point for in-class discussions
that will follow.","Some suggested formatting of your posts:
• Title the post with the class session and your descriptive heading (e.g., Session 2: Why
Should Context Matter?). A good heading should invite others to click on your post and
read/respond. And by labeling with the class session, I can better distinguish one week
from another when I read your posts across the entire semester.
• Your posts should be broken into short paragraphs. A single blob of text is uninviting to
read – in class and in the real world you’ll be working in eventually.
• Focus on a single topic; don’t try to cover everything in the readings. you can better
articulate your insights by selecting a theme and focusing.",

Neither are required though. If you have PC you should get the free version of ARENA software, or on the mac setup your remote desktop software.","We will have two (non-required) textbooks. The first one will be
used in the lectures and the second one will be used in the labs.
• Jerry Banks, John S. Carson II, Barry L. Nelson, and David M. Nicol, Discrete-Event System
Simulation, 5th edition, Prentice Hall, 2010
• W. David Kelton, Randall P. Sadowski, and Nancy B. Zupick, Simulation with Arena, McGraw
Hill.
I recommend (but do not require) obtaining a copy of the first textbook if possible, as we will be
following that book closely. The US edition or the International edition are the same as far as I can tell,
and the 4th edition is largely similar to the 5th edition too, so all these editions can work. The second
textbook on the Arena software is a good reference if you are looking for one, but not required.","We will use the ARENA software in the lab. This software is available
on computers in OSU Baker Systems labs, and via remote access.
A free student version of the software is available for Windows devices and can be obtained from the
software’s website; the capabilities of this free version are sufficient for the lab, and therefore you may
choose to use this on your personal device to complete labs if you’d like. A Mac version is not available;
therefore, if you are a Mac-user, you can plan to use remote desktop to access ARENA on OSU computers
when not on campus. Finally, note that while the free student version will have sufficient capabilities for
completing the labs, you will likely need the full licensed version, available on Baker System computers,
to complete the course project.",,,,,,,,
