    "question":"What are the sections required in the reform paper?",
    "answer":"The reform paper is required to be about six pages, and will need to contain the following four topics: an introduction, a description of the legal activity, and overview of the potential for bias, and an actual reform proposal.",
    "answer_span_1":"Your paper must be at least six full pages in length. It will consist of four main parts:\n1) Introduction: The introduction will consist of two paragraphs (about 1-1 ½ pages). You will begin\nwith an especially engaging opening paragraph regarding the legal activity and form of bias you are\ngoing to write about to draw the reader in. For instance, you might provide a brief example of a reallife story. Or you might ask the reader to imagine a situation.\nThe second paragraph will begin with two sentences that clearly state the legal activity you will write\nabout, the form of bias you will discuss, and the proposed reform for mitigating this bias. This\nparagraph should also contain a discussion of why this legal activity is important and in need of\nreform. For example, if you were writing about racial disparities in traffic stops, your second\nparagraph might begin with something like this: “People of color are more frequently pulled over by\npolice for traffic violations. I believe this form of bias should be remedied by [your reform\nproposal].” Or, if you were writing about gender bias in oral arguments in appellate courts, you\nmight write: “Research shows that judges interrupt female attorneys more often than male attorneys.\nI believe this form of bias can be remedied by [your reform proposal].” Or, if you were writing\nabout how individuals who cannot afford attorneys might be disadvantaged, you might write:\n“Research shows that individuals who cannot afford attorneys are disadvantaged in litigation\ncompared to those with legal counsel. This disadvantage can be remedied by [your reform\nproposal].” You would follow these two sentences with 4-8 sentences explaining why the legal\nactivity is important and in need of reform.\n",
    "answer_span_2":"2) Description of Legal Activity: In a page or two, you will explain the legal activity that you are\nwriting about. Here, I want you to concisely cover the main aspects of the legal activity that is the\nfocus of your paper, including who the main actors are, what factors influence their actions, how\n3\nthose actions take place, and the consequences of those actions. For instance, if you were writing\nabout disparities in traffic stops, you would discuss the guidelines for making traffic stops, who\nmakes the decision to pull someone over, what factors guide the decision to pull someone over, and\nthe consequences of pulling someone over.\n",
    "answer_span_3":"3) Potential for Bias: In about two pages, you will explain how bias can infiltrate the legal activity\nyou are writing about, drawing on research into the topic you are writing about. Here, you will\naddress a number of points, including: how might bias creep into the legal activity you have\nidentified? What evidence is there to suggest that bias has infiltrated the legal activity you have\nidentified? What type of bias is it and why is this bias problematic?",
    "answer_span_4":"4) Reform Proposal: In about two pages, you will present your reform proposal for mitigating the\nbias you have identified. Be sure to address the following: How might you diminish or eliminate the\nbias you have identified? What actors are involved in regulating the act you have identified? What\nstrategy do you think is the best way to get the actors involved in setting policy in this area to\nremedy the bias you have identified?",
