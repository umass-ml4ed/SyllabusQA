    "answer":"Students are required to complete each week's assigned readings and attend class. There will be quizzes in many class meetings. There are 3 exams over the semester. A final assignment where you will build a hypothetical animal. The last required part is the 1 credit laboratory section associated with the class.",
    "answer_span_1":"I. General\nEach week’s assigned readings will be available for download from Moodle the previous Friday, and\nlectures (.pptx) will be available for review the evening before class. Attendance is expected. You will not be\nable to obtain all of the necessary information from the lecture slides or readings alone.\n",
    "answer_span_2":"II. Quizzes\nMany class meetings will begin with a short quiz that will cover that day’s assigned readings. Quizzes will\nbe i&gt;clicker based and there will be 14 of them. Assigned readings should therefore be done before class! There\nwill be no make-up quizzes. Instead, I will drop your 4 lowest quiz grades. Thus, your final quiz grade will be\nbased on 10 quizzes.\n",
    "answer_span_3":"III. Exams\nYou will have three exams over the course of the semester. They will not be cumulative. I will provide more\ninformation about these as they near.\n",
    "answer_span_4":"IV.Creatively scientific writing\nThis is your final assignment where you will show off everything that you have learned over the semester:\nBuild me a hypothetical animal – a “hopeful monster”. Tell me where this animal lives and how it is adapted\nto its environment. Most importantly, you should be able to connect the dots from (i) genetic alterations\/\nmutations, (ii) through morphogenesis, (iii) to the production of the phenotype. While a creative exercise, you\nwill be evaluated based on the science behind your “story”. As such, this endeavor should be scientifically\ngrounded and based on real processes (use citations!). Convince me that this could happen - e.g., you must be\nmindful of the rules of development and evolution. The paper should be no more than 5 pages (1.5 line spacing,\nexcluding references or figures\/illustrations).\nWe will dedicate time in the lab to discuss your papers and tips for how to select and research traits that you\nwill endow your creature with (you need at least 3). You will also turn in an annotated bibliography (9+\nreferences minimum — 3\/trait) before the Thanksgiving break. I will provide critical feedback, and the exercise\nwill contribute 5% of your total course grade.\n",
    "answer_span_5":"V.Laboratory section\nThere will be a 1 credit (3 hour\/week) laboratory section associated with this class. Herein we will explore\nthe development and evolution of an important novelty – the vertebrate jaw. In particular, we will use the jaw as\na paradigm in which to explore the concepts of “modularity” and “individualization” in the development and\nevolution of animal body plans. In the lab, you will be guided through a series of exercises that will expose you\nto the integrative nature of evo-devo, and allow you to gain practical experience in a wide range of techniques\nused in the field, from experimental embryology to statistical shape analyses. Most meetings will begin with a\nbrief lecture, and\/or review of the day’s assigned reading, followed by a “hands on” exercise.\nBroadly, the lab will be divided into 3 themes: Anatomy, Development and Evolution. Following an initial\nsurvey of skull diversity across vertebrates, we will explore the developmental origins and pattering of the jaw\nskeleton using a popular animal model – the zebrafish. The semester will end with an analysis of co-evolution\nof different skeletal elements across a particularly successful group of fishes — cichlids from East Africa.\nDetails of your lab grade will be provided in lab.\n",

For example, if\nmy “Course Total” halfway through the semester is 124 points and the maximum value in the\n“Range” is 150 points, then my percentage is 82.67% (124\/150 = 0.8267), which corresponds to\na B-. The Moodle course totals will take any drops\/extra credit into account. (Note: Early on in\nthe semester, Moodle may automatically drop an assignment you completed because it is your\nlowest-scored item at that time—even if you got a 100% on it. This will effectively self-correct\nover the course of the semester, but please keep this in mind when calculating your grade.)",

There will be regular homework assignments, which will be distributed via Moodle. The assignments will take a number of different forms: problem solving homeworks (7), participation in an experiment (1) (sign up here:\nhttp:\/\/umassxling.sona-systems.com), participation in online quizzes (1) and surveys that you will conduct (10). All assignments must be typed and submitted electronically via\nMoodle in pdf format unless indicated otherwise. Due dates will be given in the instructions for\nassignments. Late assignments will be accepted as long as you submit them at the beginning of\nthe class period immediately following the due date. This is the extended due date. However, you\nwill lose twenty percent of the total points if you submit your assignments late. No credit will be\ngiven for assignments submitted after the extended due date. Exceptions will be made when\nyou provide advance notice of religious observance (https:\/\/www.umass.edu\/gateway\/\nreligious-observance) or written documentation in the event of serious illness or some\nother compelling event.",

It is also the case that you may be at minor disadvantage in that you would have to expend slightly more time in converting your files into the necessary format over the course of the semester. This may also make organizing yoru data slightly more cumbersome and challenging. Because of this, it is recommended that you have access to a computer with MS Word or PowerPoint, but again, it is possible to do well in this course with a Mac (instead of a Windows machine) - more work may be necessary, though, with respect to logistics.

Third, out of respect to your\nclassmates’ schedules, we have to follow a consistent and predictable timeline in order to\nensure the peer evaluations are completed successfully and that feedback is received in a\ntimely fashion. Finally, I am overseeing almost 140 students across my classes this semester\nand it is simply not workable for me to keep up with different deadlines and late submissions.\nTrust me, I’ve tried.",

    "answer":"Your research assignments represent instances in which you actively collect and analyze real-world customer data. These instances can be divided into (1) field notes and (2) one recorded interview. The field notes represent instances in which you conduct observational research (for example, by observing how customers make purchases and\/'or consume goods at a coffee shop). You'll have to make field notes a total of five times throughout this course.\n\nMeanwhile, the interview represents an instance in which you have a one-on-one RECORDED interview (either in person or virtually via teleconferencing software) with someone who identifies as a customer of some product or good. You'll only have to do an interview once, but you will be responsible for creating the data file, writing a transcript and analyzing the data in this interview. ",
    "answer_span_1":"Over the course of the semester, you will collect and analyze real-world customer data.",
    "answer_span_2":"Fieldnotes:\nDuring the semester, you will write fieldnotes about customer situations that you experience or observe in the real world (e.g., retail, food service, recreation, fitness, social gatherings, etc.).

    "answer_span_3":"Customer Interviews:\nYou will each plan and conduct an in-depth interview with a customer. This can be done inperson or virtually, using Zoom, Skype, FaceTime or another video call technology. The interview must be recorded to allow you to retain as much data as possible by transcribing it.",
