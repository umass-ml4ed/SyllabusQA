It will consist of four main parts:
1) Introduction: The introduction will consist of two paragraphs (about 1-1 ½ pages). You will begin
with an especially engaging opening paragraph regarding the legal activity and form of bias you are
going to write about to draw the reader in. For instance, you might provide a brief example of a reallife story. Or you might ask the reader to imagine a situation.
The second paragraph will begin with two sentences that clearly state the legal activity you will write
about, the form of bias you will discuss, and the proposed reform for mitigating this bias. This
paragraph should also contain a discussion of why this legal activity is important and in need of
reform. For example, if you were writing about racial disparities in traffic stops, your second
paragraph might begin with something like this: “People of color are more frequently pulled over by
police for traffic violations. I believe this form of bias should be remedied by [your reform
proposal].” Or, if you were writing about gender bias in oral arguments in appellate courts, you
might write: “Research shows that judges interrupt female attorneys more often than male attorneys.
I believe this form of bias can be remedied by [your reform proposal].” Or, if you were writing
about how individuals who cannot afford attorneys might be disadvantaged, you might write:
“Research shows that individuals who cannot afford attorneys are disadvantaged in litigation
compared to those with legal counsel. This disadvantage can be remedied by [your reform
proposal].” You would follow these two sentences with 4-8 sentences explaining why the legal
activity is important and in need of reform.
","2) Description of Legal Activity: In a page or two, you will explain the legal activity that you are
writing about. Here, I want you to concisely cover the main aspects of the legal activity that is the
focus of your paper, including who the main actors are, what factors influence their actions, how
3
those actions take place, and the consequences of those actions. For instance, if you were writing
about disparities in traffic stops, you would discuss the guidelines for making traffic stops, who
makes the decision to pull someone over, what factors guide the decision to pull someone over, and
the consequences of pulling someone over.
","3) Potential for Bias: In about two pages, you will explain how bias can infiltrate the legal activity
you are writing about, drawing on research into the topic you are writing about. Here, you will
address a number of points, including: how might bias creep into the legal activity you have
identified? What evidence is there to suggest that bias has infiltrated the legal activity you have
identified? What type of bias is it and why is this bias problematic?","4) Reform Proposal: In about two pages, you will present your reform proposal for mitigating the
bias you have identified. Be sure to address the following: How might you diminish or eliminate the
bias you have identified? What actors are involved in regulating the act you have identified? What
strategy do you think is the best way to get the actors involved in setting policy in this area to
remedy the bias you have identified?",,,,,,
