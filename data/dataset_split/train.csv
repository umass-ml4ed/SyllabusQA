There will be quizzes in many class meetings. There are 3 exams over the semester. A final assignment where you will build a hypothetical animal. The last required part is the 1 credit laboratory section associated with the class.,"I. General
Each week’s assigned readings will be available for download from Moodle the previous Friday, and
lectures (.pptx) will be available for review the evening before class. Attendance is expected. You will not be
able to obtain all of the necessary information from the lecture slides or readings alone.
","II. Quizzes
Many class meetings will begin with a short quiz that will cover that day’s assigned readings. Quizzes will
be i&gt;clicker based and there will be 14 of them. Assigned readings should therefore be done before class! There
will be no make-up quizzes. Instead, I will drop your 4 lowest quiz grades. Thus, your final quiz grade will be
based on 10 quizzes.
","III. Exams
You will have three exams over the course of the semester. They will not be cumulative. I will provide more
information about these as they near.
","IV.Creatively scientific writing
This is your final assignment where you will show off everything that you have learned over the semester:
Build me a hypothetical animal – a “hopeful monster”. Tell me where this animal lives and how it is adapted
to its environment. Most importantly, you should be able to connect the dots from (i) genetic alterations/
mutations, (ii) through morphogenesis, (iii) to the production of the phenotype. While a creative exercise, you
will be evaluated based on the science behind your “story”. As such, this endeavor should be scientifically
grounded and based on real processes (use citations!). Convince me that this could happen - e.g., you must be
mindful of the rules of development and evolution. The paper should be no more than 5 pages (1.5 line spacing,
excluding references or figures/illustrations).
We will dedicate time in the lab to discuss your papers and tips for how to select and research traits that you
will endow your creature with (you need at least 3). You will also turn in an annotated bibliography (9+
references minimum — 3/trait) before the Thanksgiving break. I will provide critical feedback, and the exercise
will contribute 5% of your total course grade.
","V.Laboratory section
There will be a 1 credit (3 hour/week) laboratory section associated with this class. Herein we will explore
the development and evolution of an important novelty – the vertebrate jaw. In particular, we will use the jaw as
a paradigm in which to explore the concepts of “modularity” and “individualization” in the development and
evolution of animal body plans. In the lab, you will be guided through a series of exercises that will expose you
to the integrative nature of evo-devo, and allow you to gain practical experience in a wide range of techniques
used in the field, from experimental embryology to statistical shape analyses. Most meetings will begin with a
brief lecture, and/or review of the day’s assigned reading, followed by a “hands on” exercise.
Broadly, the lab will be divided into 3 themes: Anatomy, Development and Evolution. Following an initial
survey of skull diversity across vertebrates, we will explore the developmental origins and pattering of the jaw
skeleton using a popular animal model – the zebrafish. The semester will end with an analysis of co-evolution
of different skeletal elements across a particularly successful group of fishes — cichlids from East Africa.
Details of your lab grade will be provided in lab.

“Grades.” Under “Course Total” (last row), divide the value in the third column (“Grade”) by the

you can translate into a letter grade by reviewing the Grading Standard below. For example, if
my “Course Total” halfway through the semester is 124 points and the maximum value in the
“Range” is 150 points, then my percentage is 82.67% (124/150 = 0.8267), which corresponds to
a B-. The Moodle course totals will take any drops/extra credit into account. (Note: Early on in
the semester, Moodle may automatically drop an assignment you completed because it is your
lowest-scored item at that time—even if you got a 100% on it. This will effectively self-correct
over the course of the semester, but please keep this in mind when calculating your grade.)","A: Achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course

llU30HkLjH3dlrPi,Acct 371 Syllabus - Spring,multi factual,What will make up the grade for the class?,"Grading for the class will include exams, tax return problems, homework, quizzes, and in class assignments.","Exams:
The exams will be outside of class time to reduce time stress. I will describe the layout
of the exams beforehand. The exams will be open book. If you miss an exam I will give
a make-up exam for extreme reasons, be prepared to take a make-up as soon as possible.
I follow the rules of the Academic Regulations issued by the University. These rules
require written proof of an acceptable absence. With that said, I will need written proof if
you are not able to make an exam. I cannot give makeups simply because you feel
inadequately prepared as that seems unfair to the class as a whole. Please contact me
in advance if you will miss an exam. The exams will be in the evenings and the times
will be confirmed as soon as possible. I will follow the University final exam schedule
so please do not schedule yourself to be unavailable during finals week.","Tax Return Problem:
The tax return problem will be due on the last day of class and will consist of the
preparation of an actual income tax return on IRS forms. You will do the tax return that
will be available on Blackboard. The tax return may be worked on in teams. The
maximum amount of students per team is 4. If you decide to work on this as a team
3
please let me know who is on your team. At the appropriate time I will give out several
key figures to assist you in the preparation of the return.","Homework:
Homework will be done on CengageNOW (CNOW) (on-line). The homework will
consist of problems at the end of the chapter that will be assigned to you in
CNOW/Blackboard. I will assign homework problems for each chapter. We will also
have “Friday Homework” instead of meeting for class on Friday’s. This homework will
consist of completing tax forms associated with the material covered in class. I will
allow you to miss one homework assignment without deducting points. While
homework is graded in CNOW, your final grade will be based on completion of the
homework assignment (i.e. participation).","Pre-Class Quiz:
There will be short quizzes before each Chapter that we cover. The quizzes will consist
of various types of questions/problems that will be completed in CNOW. These quizzes
are to ensure that you read the material and are prepared to work on problems in class. I
expect you to have an understanding of the material before we meet in class. These
quizzes will be due before we meet to cover the material in class.
Quizzes:
There will be short quizzes each week during the semester in CNOW for each Chapter
we cover. There will be approximately 13 quizzes during the semester. I will drop the
lowest 2 quizzes. Each quiz will consist of 5 multiple choice questions. The quizzes will
be after we covered the material in class. I want to see if you understood the material
covered in class. I find in taxes that actually working the problems out re-enforces the
learning process.","In-Class Assignments:
Classes will consist of working on various problems on CNOW in groups, as a class or
with one of you leading the class. I will be a resource you can use to answer any
questions that you may have on these problems. While in-class assignments are graded
in CNOW, your final grade will be based on completion of the in-class assignment

often by tying the material to contemporary issues and events, and engaging in activities
designed to help you make progress on your Course Project. There will be very little lecturing
during class time, which means that your participation is crucial to the success of this course. At
the end of each class, you will rate your own participation in that day’s class. This will serve as
the basis of your participation grade (see “Grading Approach” below).","You will be working with three classmates on a group-based
course project over the duration of the semester. You will be assigned, based on your collective
interests, an issue of international scope as well as one journalistic outlet from each of two
different countries (two organizations in total). The project will ultimately require you to
synthesize the theories and concepts we’ve discussed in class; describe the context within
which those journalistic outlets operate (i.e., the countries’ media systems); evaluate the
journalistic content produced by those outlets about the given issue; discuss your findings in
light of what we’ve learned this semester; and reflect on what you learned from completing this
assignment, and on what you might have done differently if you were a journalist working for
those outlets. ",": In Week 3, you will be assigned a non-fiction book written by an international
journalist. (Please do not purchase a book before being assigned it!) You will be expected to

You should also make sure you do all of the homework, as there is no making it up or turning it in late. ",,,,,,"Grades will be given on an absolute scale (not curved). This means that
your grades will be based only on your accomplishments and that you are not in competition
with other students for grades in this course.",": In line with the grading philosophy described above, you will determine the
quality of your participation yourself at the end of each class via a short survey. (That
assessment will be blended with a basic completion check for in-class activities.) For each
Project Checkpoint assignment you submit, you will evaluate the assignment submitted by one
other group (external evaluation) and perform a peer evaluation of the contributions of your
groupmates (internal evaluation).","In practice, this means that I will rely largely
on self-evaluations and peer evaluations when determining the grades for some of the different
course requirements. I am doing this for two main reasons. First, peer grading is actually a good
way to learn because it not only allows you to see how others approached the same challenge
but it forces you to actively process their responses (in order to offer an evaluation). Second,
having me assign the grades can have the unintended effect of promoting ideological conformity
by having students produce work based on what they think I want, which is not the most
conducive way to learn.","Attendance is not formally required in this course, but it is a prerequisite for

Over the course of the semester, you will collect and analyze real-world customer data. This
ongoing research activity enables you to practice and develop a set of insight generation skills as
a customer experience researcher. It also provides data that will allow you to answer research
questions that address your group’s customer insight challenge. ","Fieldnotes:
During the semester, you will write fieldnotes about customer situations that you experience or
observe in the real world (e.g., retail, food service, recreation, fitness, social gatherings, etc.).
You must submit five fieldnotes during the course of the semester. Four are due at specified
times, and the fifth can be submitted any time before the group data report is due (May 9 before
class). You will use your notes to practice analyzing customer experiences in many of our lab
sessions, and they will also become data for your group’s final project. Instructions are on
Blackboard. ","Customer Interviews:
You will each plan and conduct an in-depth interview with a customer. This can be done inperson or virtually, using Zoom, Skype, FaceTime or another video call technology. The
interview must be recorded to allow you to retain as much data as possible by transcribing it.
You cannot interview another undergraduate student or someone who you know more than just
in passing (e.g., you should not interview a roommate or a friend or family member). A member
of your project group can refer a friend, family member, or other acquaintance for you to contact
and interview. You can do the same for another group member. More detailed instructions about
the interview assignments will be provided after we cover interview techniques in the class. ","Group Research Project:
The culmination of the course will be a group research project. I will form teams based on
student interests and experience in an effort to create well-rounded groups. Each project will
involve identifying a research problem, proposing specific research questions, collecting and
analyzing qualitative data, and creating actionable insights. Projects will be graded in five parts:
1. Group project plan (10 pts)
2. Data collection and analysis report (50 pts)
3. Customer journey map (80 pts)
4. Executive summary (80 pts)
5. Class presentation (80 pts)
Insights gained from your individual assignments will contribute toward this group research
project. Your individual research will form the data set your group will draw on to develop
customer insights. You must complete individual assignments on your own. However, after
submitting these assignments, I encourage you to share and compare insights from individual
research with your project group members. During the last third of the semester, the focus of the
class will shift to group-level data collection and analysis. ",,,,,,

In addition to the instruction and discussions, many classes will start with a short quiz, and even if you miss all 5 questions on this quiz, you will still earn 50 points out of 100.

It is also the case that you may be at minor disadvantage in that you would have to expend slightly more time in converting your files into the necessary format over the course of the semester. This may also make organizing yoru data slightly more cumbersome and challenging. Because of this, it is recommended that you have access to a computer with MS Word or PowerPoint, but again, it is possible to do well in this course with a Mac (instead of a Windows machine) - more work may be necessary, though, with respect to logistics. ",,,,,,"Under Section 11, it is stated that students require access to a computer with Microsoft Word and Powerpoint installed to complete course assignments. ",It is also stated that such programs are available for Mac and Windows platforms for free.,"Finally, it is stated that assignments can be submitted as either Word, Powerpoint, or PDF format. ","In light of the above, it's not a problem per se for the student to use their Mac computer to do work as they please (e.g., making notes, communicating with teammates). As long as the student is able to convert their assignments into the appropriate format (e.g., using the tools made available for free by the university or by converting their work to a .pdf file), they should be fine. ","Though not necessarily a problem, one shortcoming of using a macintosh computer may be that more time would be needed to make conversions as necessary."

soon as possible to discuss assignments missed, class discussion, etc.

teaching. I feel that you as the student deserve to know what kinds of political and social views I may have, which
tend to be liberal in nature. However, I will present the course material as straightforwardly as possible. The goal of
the course is not for me to convince you that my beliefs are ‘correct’ or for me to get you to agree with everything I
say. Rather, my goal is to introduce you to tools and resources for you to make sense of the course material and to critically examine our society, the important social issues of today, and your personal experiences.

OoDrmdxjnv3xPePl,130 syllabus_2 S 2023,multi factual,Can I pass this course just by memorizing information?,There are many components of the class that require analysis and discussion. Simply memorizing data from the readings will not be sufficient to pass the course.,"The course should include critical thinking.
At various times throughout the semester students will be presented with an in-class writing prompt. These will
ask you to reflect on information presented in the lecture and ask you to consider an implication or analysis based
on this information. You will need to defend your opinion in this writing prompt. This is not an exam, and we will
share opinions on the prompt during class.
In discussion, students are asked to analyze nutrient data, and adjust food intake to meet nutrient standards for a
given inadequate diet. You will also analyze nutrient focused websites and compare research findings to reports
in news articles.
The extra-credit assignments posted on Moodle will require critical thinking because they ask you to read an
article or watch a media piece and complete a questionnaire that will ask you to answer questions and defend an
opinion based on what you just learned.","The course should address the relevance of the science and its impact on society.
As we discuss each nutrient, we will explore the health and societal implications for the US and global
communities of health issues related to that nutrient.
We will pull apart the impact of genetics, human behavioral, human social factors and politics on health issues
mediated through nutrition.
We will discuss health disparity in the context of environmental associations with health and disease.","Most, but not all, weeks will have an in-class writing prompt. These will ask you to reflect on information presented in the
lecture and ask you to consider an implication or analysis based on this information. The questions are meant to have to
think at a high level of learning (as discussed in my first lecture). These questions must be completed on the day that I
present the topic in lecture. The analysis required to answer these questions will not be on the exam. We will drop the
lowest two scores.","There are two parts to this assignment:
1. For two days (one weekday and one weekend day) you will record what you eat, keeping track of time and your
hunger and fullness as well as other influences on your eating before and after the meal on a Food/Eating Log.
You will also break each food down into the components described by the dietary guidelines.
2. You will do an analysis of your food intake (as recorded in your Food/Eating Log) using Chronometer (a free
website)
When you bring your completed Food Intake Analysis to discussion, your TA will guide you so that you can correct
any errors. It is important that you are as accurate as possible when completing this Homework assignment, because
there are a number of discussion activities that use your completed Food Intake Analysis.","Many students fail this class because they do not go to discussion. The total points for discussion attendance,

","There is a no-exceptions policy for late work, but your lowest score will be dropped, giving you some leeway. ","Assignments are not eligible for late submissions or
extensions. There are four reasons for this. First, you have at least one week to complete all
assignments (aside from the participation ones), so there is ample time to complete them.
Second, most assignment categories have some form of automatic drop that is designed to
account for unforeseen circumstances or involve group work. Third, out of respect to your
classmates’ schedules, we have to follow a consistent and predictable timeline in order to
ensure the peer evaluations are completed successfully and that feedback is received in a
timely fashion. Finally, I am overseeing almost 140 students across my classes this semester
and it is simply not workable for me to keep up with different deadlines and late submissions.
Trust me, I’ve tried.","Early on in
the semester, Moodle may automatically drop an assignment you completed because it is your
lowest-scored item at that time—even if you got a 100% on it. This will effectively self-correct
